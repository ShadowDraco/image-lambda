# LAB - Class 17

## Project: S3 and Lambda

### Author: Ethan Storm

- To use the lambda simply upldoad a new image into the estorm-lab-17 S3 Bucket! Ensure that it is a .jpg

Deploying this lambda came with many issues and a LOT of
trial and error,
reading the docs was practically useless at times thought there were a few pages
_FEW_ that were very helpful

- Link to my [images.json](https://estorm-lab-17.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.json) in the bucket first 2 were handwritten and the 3rd and 4th were input by my lambda! LESS GOOOOOOOOO
